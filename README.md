## Intruduce

When you study a language, you sometimes have to listen to it repeatedly to understand what you lack. 
However, existing audio players moved for a few seconds or only provided AB section functionality.
In addition, when doing "shadowing," known as an effective English study method, there were many inconveniences with existing audio players.
Therefore, this app separates audio by sentence so that audio sentences can be found more conveniently and accurately than existing audio players.
